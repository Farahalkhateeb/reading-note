**An introduction to wireframing**

Wireframing is a way to design a website service at the structural level. A wireframe is commonly used to layout content and functionality on a page which takes into account user needs and user journeys. Wireframes are used early in the development process to establish the basic structure of a page before visual design and content is added.

**Examples of wireframes**

1.  Simple, hand-drawn wireframe
2.  Low-fidelity wireframe
3. Wireframe with user journey
4.  Wireframe with multiple search options
5. Detailed, hand-drawn wireframe
6.  High-fidelity wireframe



**Things to consider when choosing a wireframing process**

* Wireframing is essential in UI design
* A wireframe is much easier to adapt than a concept design
* Wireframing takes place early in the project lifecycle

**How to make your wireframe in six steps?**

1. Do your research
2.  Prepare your research for quick reference
3. Make sure you have your user flow mapped out
4. Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate
5.  Add some detail and get testing
6. Start turning your wireframes into prototypes

**How to make your Wireframe Good: 3 Key Principles**

* Clarity
Your wireframe needs to answer the questions of what that site page is, what the user can do there, and if it satisfies their needs. 

* Confidence
Ease of navigation through your site and clear calls-to-action increase user confidence in your brand. If your site page is unpredictable, or has buttons or boxes in unexpected places user confidence diminishes. A lot of this information can already be organized at the wireframing stage.

* Simplicity is key
Too much information, copy, or links, can be distracting to the user and will have a detrimental affect on your users’ ability to achieve their goals. You want your users to be able to find their way through your site with as little extra ‘fluff’ as possible, to the elements that map to their most significant goals in a given context.

** What is the HTML**

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.

in the html the semantics vary from other like this:

<h1>This is a top level heading</h1>
