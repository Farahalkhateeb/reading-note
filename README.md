### summarize for midset
###### The mind is sometimes seen as a static, non-developable tool that has basic features such as intelligence, but it is fixed, but with the knowledge of the so-called growth mindset, the intelligence of the fixed mind can be developed with more perseverance and diligence to develop it.

 ###### We can transform our mentality from a fixed mentality to a mentality of development and growth, by putting the mind in several challenges. Increase the perceptions of the mind, increase the effort placed on the mind and make positive criticism that will develop the mind and increase its growth and productivity.
 # I involve my mind with many challenges to make it permanently growing by
 1. reading
 2.  increasing and making the extra effort such as enrolling in courses that would keep me up to date with all developments in my field of specialization.
 3.  Challenges and difficulties
