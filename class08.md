# html layout


HTML layouts provide a way to arrange web pages in well-mannered, well-structured, and in responsive form or we can say that HTML layout specifies a way in which the web pages can be arranged. Web-page layout works with arrangement of visual elements of an HTML document.

Web page layout is the most important part to keep in mind while creating a website so that our website can appear professional with the great look. You can also use CSS and JAVASCRIPT based frameworks for creating layouts for responsive and dynamic website designing.

Every website has a specific layout to display content in a specific manner.

Following are different HTML5 elements which are used to define the different parts of a webpage.

header>: It is used to define a header for a document or a section.
nav>: It is used to define a container for navigation links
section>: It is used to define a section in a document
article>: It is used to define an independent self-contained article
aside>: It is used to define content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
footer>: It is used to define a footer for a document or a section
details>: It is used to define additional details
summary>: It is used to define a heading for the details> element

NOTE: HTML layouts create an individual space for every part of the web page. So that every element can arrange in a significant order.

div> elements are often used as containing elements
to group together sections of a page.
 Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
 Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
 Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
 Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
 CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
 You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
