**INTRODUCTION**

*Prerequisites*

this is how we use Git
Before beginning this tutorial, it is highly recommended that you have a solid understanding of the Terminal (for Mac) or Command Line (for Windows and Linux).
In order to explain Git, we have to first explain various aspects of Version Control.

### version Control

#### What is “version control”, and why should you care?

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

### Local Version Control

Many people’s version-control method of choice is to copy files into another directory (perhaps a time-stamped directory, if they’re clever). This approach is very common because it is so simple, but it is also incredibly error prone. It is easy to forget which directory you’re in and accidentally write to the wrong file or copy over files you don’t mean to.

### Centralized Version Control


Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCSs) were
 developed. have a single server that contains all the versioned files, and a number of clients that check out files from that central place. 

 ### Distributed Version Control Systems


 his is where Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCSs) step in. if any server dies, and these systems were collaborating via that server, any of the client repositories can be copied back up to the server to restore it. Every clone is really a full backup of all the data.

 # So, what is Git?

 1. snapshots
 2. local operations
 3. tracking changes
 4. loss of data
 5. states
