Links are created using the <a> element.
 The <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate
the page you are linking to.
 If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is
best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
 You can create links to open email programs with an
email address in the "to" field.
 You can use the id attribute to target elements within
a page that can be linked to.

example for links:
![links](https://d2h0cx97tjks2p.cloudfront.net/blogs/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/06/Links-in-HTML.jpg).



div elements are often used as containing elements
to group together sections of a page.
 Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
 The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
 Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
 Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
 Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
 CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
 You can include multiple CSS files in one page.




# js


Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example,
you might specify that a value must be remembered
before creating a calculation using that value.
Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of
information used in the script.
Arrays are special types of variables that store more
than one piece of related information.
JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9),
strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
Expressions evaluate into a single value.
Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.
