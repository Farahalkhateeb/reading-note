# SUMMARIZE THE Mastering Markdown on GitHub
###### Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax aimed at making writing for the internet easier.
###### The philosophy behind Markdown is that plain text documents should be readable without tags mussing everything up,
###### but there should still be ways to add text modifiers like lists, bold, italics, etc. 
###### It is an alternative to WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editors, which use rich text that later gets converted to proper HTML.
###### It’s possible you’ve encountered Markdown without realizing it. Facebook chat, Skype, and Reddit all let you use different flavors of Markdown to format your messages.
