## html text

 1. HTML elements are used  to describe the structure of
the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).

2. They also provide semantic information (e.g. where
emphasis should be placed, the definition of any
acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

When creating a web page, you add tags
(known as markup) to the contents of the
page. These tags provide extra meaning
and allow browsers to show users the
appropriate structure for the page. 
here i summarize all of the markup in the chapter:


|markup          |describtion       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|" <p>  </p>  "  | to creat paragraph |
|" <h>   </h> "   | to creat headings     |

| "<b>   </b>"    |   bold by enclosing words in that tag |
|" <i>     </i>"             | enclosing words in thix tag characters appears italic |
|  "<sup>   </sup>"           |    contain character that should be super script as suffix of date |
|  "<sub> </sub> "|     contain character that should be sub script as chemical formulas |
| "<br></br>" | new line |
|<hr></hr> " | add horizantal rule |
| " <strong></strong>" | strong importance |
| " <em></em> "| emphasis in italic |
|"<q></q>"  | shorter quotes| 
|"<blockquote>"| longer quote |
| "<abbr></abbr>" | abbriviations|
|" <cite></cite>" | citations |
|"<dfn></dfn>"  | difinitions |
|"<address></address>"| author details like adress|
|"<ins></ins>" | insert content |
|"<del></del> "| delete content |
|"<s></s>"| strike through |



# css summary 


 * CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that
element should look. Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that
indicate what these elements should look like).
* Different types of selectors allow you to target your
rules at different elements.
* Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
of the element that you want to change, and the values
of those properties. For example, the font-family
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
* CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page.

# js summary 

Functions allow you to group a set of related
statements together that represent a single task.
Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required
to do their job) and may return a value.
An object is a series of variables and functions that
represent something from the world around you.
In an object, variables are known as properties of the
object; functions are known as methods of the object.
Web browsers implement objects that represent both
the browser window and the document loaded into the
browser window.
JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as
String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and
methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.
Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data
sets (and both can contain the other).
